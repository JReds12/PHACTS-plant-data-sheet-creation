# PHACTS Plant Data Sheet Creation

The PHACTS project from the. [Baucom Lab](https://baucomlab.wordpress.com/) at the University of Michigan looked at native prairie and common invasive plant species response to the herbicide dicamba. The project included 21 different species. Pollen and nectar samples were collected from plants. To keep track of life history and taxononomic traits, an R script was created to organize data the *taxize* package and web scraping from the [Prairie Moon Nursery website](https://www.prairiemoon.com/).
